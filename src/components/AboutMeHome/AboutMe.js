        <p>I am a driven, self-motivated people-person who enjoys setting personal goals and striving to achieve them. Whilst I have a competitive nature, I am also a team player and use my drive and determination to motivate and empower my team or fellow team members. I am able to apply myself fully to a new role and learn quickly. I am loyal, dedicated, honest, and have excellent customer service skills. I genuinely enjoy getting to know people and building up a rapport with them.</p>
