## Description
Welcome to my React-powered super portfolio; the MACH-3 of my portfolios, bigger, better and more powerful than ever! I liked the design of my current portfolio so have taken many elements from it but this time, it's a single page app!!! The majority of content is not even contained on the page itself, rather, it is 'pulled' through a component that renders the objects. This was AMAZING to build and stretched my knowledge to the very limits but was the BEST thing I could have done. It uses a well-balanced mix of Bootstrap, custom CSS, Components and Functions as well JSON files to provide content. 

Here is a screenshot of my app:
